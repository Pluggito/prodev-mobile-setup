## 🧪 My Expo Go Setup Experience

Setting up Expo Go was actually very simple. I just followed the steps on the official Expo site (https://expo.dev/go
), and everything worked without stress.

How it went

Went to the Expo Go download page

Saw the options for Android/iOS

Downloaded it straight from the store

Opened the app, logged in, and that was it

Nothing complicated.

Small things I noticed

Expo Go must have internet before it even does anything.

When I tried scanning the QR code from expo start, my phone didn’t pick it up immediately, so I increased my screen brightness — then boom, it scanned at once.

The app asked for permissions like camera and local network. Once I allowed them, everything connected smoothly.

Testing it

I ran the usual commands:

npx create-expo-app my-app
npx expo start


Scanned the QR code and the project loaded on my phone instantly. The live reload was mad fast — any small change I made showed up almost immediately.
