🚀 Project Scaffolding Process

Alright, so here’s how I set everything up.

1. Created the Expo Project

I started by running:

npx create-expo-app my-first-expo-app


It did its thing — downloaded the files, set up the folders, and the project was ready almost immediately. No stress.

2. Opened the Project in VS Code

Next, I moved into the project and opened it in VS Code:

cd my-first-expo-app
code .


Everything opened smoothly. No errors, nothing unusual.

3. Installed Expo Go

I downloaded Expo Go on my phone from the store, opened it, logged in, and scanned the QR code.
The app loaded instantly on my device. Straightforward setup.

🔄 Observations From Running npx expo reset-project

I ran:

npx expo reset-project


Here’s what I noticed:

It basically reset the whole project structure to something cleaner.

Removed some extra files Expo doesn’t use anymore.

After the reset, the project felt lighter and loaded faster.

Nothing broke — it still ran fine when I did npx expo start.

Overall, it just refreshed the project without me having to delete and recreate anything.
